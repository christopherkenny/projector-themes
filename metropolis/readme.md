# `metropolis` theme for `projector`

This is a clean and bright theme, derivative of [`mtheme`](https://bloerg.net/posts/a-modern-beamer-theme/) via [`polylux-typ/metropolis`](https://github.com/polylux-typ/metropolis).
It uses various Fira fonts to give a modern look, along with heavy use of white space and horizon alignment.


This theme provides a custom slide theming with black text on beige and white text on black.
This includes a custom title slide which uses an orange horizontal line to separate title and authors.
Section slides are shown with the orange horizontal line lighting up as progress bar.
